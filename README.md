🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Demonstration 🚀
A simple yet effective demonstration of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Node.js, Express, and Docker. This project serves as a basic template for automating the build and deployment process of a web application.

✨ Live Demo
Check out the live deployment of this project:
ci-cd-aryan.vercel.app

🎯 Project Overview
The core purpose of this repository is to showcase a fundamental CI/CD workflow. When new code is pushed to the main branch, a process is automatically triggered to:

Build a new Docker image for the application.

Deploy the container to a hosting service, making the changes live.

This setup is ideal for learning the basics of DevOps and understanding how to automate your development workflow.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Containerization: Docker

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (or a similar service like Vercel's built-in CI/CD)

⚙️ How the CI/CD Pipeline Works
This project uses a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments. Here’s the flow:

Push to main branch ➡️ CI Server (e.g., Vercel/GitHub Actions) ➡️ Builds Docker Image ➡️ Deploys Container ➡️ Application is Live!

🚀 Getting Started Locally
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (which includes npm)

Docker

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/aryan9653/ci-cd.git](https://github.com/aryan9653/ci-cd.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd ci-cd

Install NPM packages:

npm install

Running the Application
1. Using Node.js
Start the server directly with npm.

npm start

The application will be running on http://localhost:8080.

2. Using Docker
You can also build and run the application as a Docker container.

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t ci-cd-app .

Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 -d ci-cd-app

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080. The -d flag runs the container in detached mode.
